# Smart_Recipe_Explorer
Project Overview

Smart Recipe Assistant is a web application that allows users to explore recipes and get AI-powered suggestions and simplifications of cooking instructions. Users can input ingredients, and the AI suggests recipes using only edible items. Additionally, users can view recipe details and request simplified instructions generated by AI for easier understanding.

The project uses:
Flask as the backend web framework
SQLite for recipe and AI interaction storage
OpenRouter API as the AI service to generate recipe suggestions and simplifications

#Backend Setup Steps

1.Clone the repository:
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>

2.Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

3.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Set up the database:
The app uses SQLite and will automatically create the recipes.db file and tables on first run, along with seeding initial data.

5.Run the Flask app:
python app.py

#Frontend Setup
The frontend is served via Flask templates using Jinja2. No separate frontend setup is required. HTML templates are in the templates/ folder and CSS/static files (if any) under static/.
AI API Integration Steps
The project integrates with OpenRouter AI for recipe suggestions and instruction simplification:
API calls are made inside the genai.py module.
Uses the OpenRouter chat completions endpoint to:
Suggest recipes based on user-input ingredients.
Simplify recipe instructions for beginners.
# Key points:
The prompt restricts AI suggestions to edible ingredients only.
If input contains non-food items (like "clothes"), AI returns a special "INVALID_INGREDIENTS" token, handled gracefully by the app.
AI responses are saved in the AIHistory database table.

#vEnvironment Variable Configuration

Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///recipes.db  # optional, defaults to SQLite file
FLASK_ENV=development               # optional for debug mode

Replace your_openrouter_api_key_here with your actual OpenRouter API key.
DATABASE_URL can be configured for other databases if needed.

# Sample API Requests
Home (Recipe Suggestion)
POST / with form data:
ingredients=potato,tomato,cream
Response:
Renders homepage with AI recipe suggestion based on ingredients.
Returns message if invalid ingredients detected.
Recipe Detail & Simplification

GET /recipe/<recipe_id>
View recipe details.

POST /recipe/<recipe_id>
Simplify recipe instructions using AI.

# Thought Process and Assumptions
The project focuses on a clean backend-driven web app using Flask templates for simplicity.
AI interaction is core for recipe suggestions and simplifying instructions.
The AI is restricted to edible ingredients only to avoid irrelevant or nonsensical recipe suggestions.
Data is persisted using SQLite for easy setup and local development.
Error handling and AI response validation are implemented to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
Designed for local deployment with environment variable support for flexibility.
